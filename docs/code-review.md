# Code Review Report

## High-Level Summary

The codebase is a small to medium-sized web application written in TypeScript. It appears to be a workout tracking application. The code is generally well-structured and easy to understand. However, there are several areas where it could be improved.

## Major Issues

*   **Lack of a framework:** The project doesn't use any front-end framework like React, Vue, or Angular. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it can make the code harder to maintain and scale. The current approach of manually creating and manipulating DOM elements can become cumbersome as the application grows.
*   **No state management:** There is no centralized state management solution. The application's state is scattered throughout the DOM and various variables. This can lead to inconsistencies and make it difficult to reason about the application's behavior.
*   **No tests:** There are no unit or end-to-end tests. This makes it difficult to refactor the code or add new features without introducing bugs.

## Minor Issues

*   **Inconsistent naming:** There are some inconsistencies in naming conventions. For example, some files use `camelCase` while others use `kebab-case`.
*   **Magic strings:** There are many "magic strings" used throughout the code. These are strings that have a special meaning but are not defined as constants. This makes the code harder to read and maintain.
*   **Lack of comments:** Some parts of the code are not well-commented, making it difficult to understand their purpose.
*   **Potential for race conditions:** In `src/ui/screens/today.ts`, the `renderTodayScreen` function fetches data from the database and then renders the screen. If the user navigates away from the screen before the data has been fetched, it could lead to a race condition.
*   **Use of `any` type:** The `any` type is used in a few places. While this can be useful in some cases, it should be avoided as much as possible as it undermines the benefits of TypeScript's static typing.
*   **Error handling:** The error handling is inconsistent. Some functions use `try...catch` blocks, while others do not.

## Recommendations

*   **Adopt a front-end framework:** I recommend using a front-end framework like React, Vue, or Angular to manage the UI and application state. This will make the code more maintainable and scalable.
*   **Implement a state management solution:** I recommend using a state management library like Redux or MobX to manage the application's state. This will make the code more predictable and easier to reason about.
*   **Write tests:** I recommend writing unit and end-to-end tests to ensure the code is working as expected and to prevent regressions.
*   **Establish and enforce coding standards:** I recommend establishing and enforcing a consistent set of coding standards to improve the readability and maintainability of the code.
*   **Use constants for magic strings:** I recommend defining constants for all "magic strings" to make the code more readable and maintainable.
*   **Add comments to the code:** I recommend adding comments to the code to explain its purpose and how it works.
*   **Use `async/await` to handle asynchronous operations:** I recommend using `async/await` to handle asynchronous operations in a more synchronous and readable way.
*   **Use a type-safe data access layer:** I recommend using a type-safe data access layer to prevent type errors when accessing the database.
